"""THE UNIVERSAL RECORD MODEL (URM) — named by the principal, 2026-08-20.
One object that represents the entire program, and the overall representation of the proof:
PROOF_V002 is this model's narration. "Universal" is operational — one model, any record surface
(T-33: six mechanisms at machine precision; D-25: world-tier surfaces provenance-pinned) — and is a
title, not a claim.

The principal, 2026-08-20: "We need a model to work on that represents the full project."

A RecordSurface is a physicist-supplied parameterization of a device or specimen in SI; it is
not by itself real-world validation.  Actual measurements enter separately through
URM.world_observation(), whose closed bundle preserves raw-source custody, normalization, units,
coverage, and provenance while issuing no scientific verdict.  A new law is a layer method with
a validator gate and claim row; agreement with the world requires a prospectively frozen
prediction and an actual-surface comparison with stated tolerance, semantics, and a power
control.  validate_urm.py is the integrated conjunction; validate_project.py preserves the
public-entry and backward-compatibility gates."""

            "zero because those sources commute and are conserved. This does not erase FJ's distinct "
            "conditional rank-six response. No present same-parent object simultaneously supplies six "
            "tensor configurations, nondegenerate conjugates, and the rank-two null packet. The first "
            "Q4-BLOCK-STRAIN-CTP prerequisite is now executed: four tetrahedral edge dyads have exact "
            "A1+T2 rank four and an E null of dimension two. Additive multi-edge weights, fixed Feshbach "
            "reduction, and every projected word through order eight retain that null. The complete "
            "covering-matched reduced CW/FM source has exact microscopic rank four and effective rank at "
            "most four; the degree tensor is one prospective query choice, while the unreduced physical "
            "BS source remains underdetermined. Existing degree/link/ice pair operators make E queryable "
            "and locally H6-dynamical, but identical H[0] admits rank-four additive and rank-six root-pair "
            "source derivatives. A symmetric lumped capacitance fails with exact E nullity two, while a "
            "fully grounded pair-resolved elastance and complete central kernel conditionally realize DPAR; "
            "ideal fixed-coupling Coulomb gives lambda=-1/2 without changing H[0]. Under explicit S10/FV-PURE, "
            "the projected nonidentity source has off-shell rank six. Its two explicit rank-closing pieces "
            "compose with the exact 180-state homogeneous sector in the hierarchy six family operators to "
            "five modulo identity to commutator rank three to ground retarded/first-moment rank two, with two "
            "rank-one residues. Generated Qdiag orders two, four, and six and their folds are omitted from that "
            "witness result, but their exact completion on the same component reduces them to the pair source "
            "plus identities with fE=1-x^2-(37/12)x^4-(16247/900)x^6. The complete homogeneous hierarchy "
            "therefore remains five to three to two to two with the same poles. Retaining each insertion's "
            "native A/B vertex or link-midpoint support before Fourier resolution exactly recovers m=0 and "
            "preserves all three fE coefficients at m=1 over Q(zeta_240); the ring remains a nonzero independent "
            "off-diagonal source. At x=2/5 and 1/2 the sampled finite response hierarchy is six through all five "
            "rank gates, TT ground-image rank is two, and four nonzero poles respond. Its nonzero spatial "
            "contraction excludes naive transversality. FZ proves the selected projected incidence charge is "
            "identically zero and leaves the full Ward packet undecided; GA supplies fixed-charge current ancestry, "
            "and GB supplies exact local ring-energy continuity while local momentum remains open. GC supplies the "
            "covering family, exact reciprocal momenta, and rank-two TT kinematics; FY's terminal 107-check custody "
            "replay makes this Phase A packet fully sealed. GD closes the historical direct route's G1 total-momentum gate on "
            "its declared auxiliary recoil torus without changing the FY source, and GF V005 seals that route's prospective "
            "particle-observable contract. That graviton/helicity route is now non-load-bearing for working-theory closure. "
            "The record-first completion instead uses observable pair memory C=<Y>, not the natural control J. At the symmetric "
            "localization point its six tetrahedral columns span Sym2. At a flat reference or for the locally frozen principal "

            "Its finite full-support commuting pair sector has exact source reciprocity only under GK-S1--GK-S5 and a complete "
