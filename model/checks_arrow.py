"""EVERY SEALED ARROW HEADLINE (F-17, F-18, F-19, F-21, and the PF-2 history F-20 rests
beside), REPRODUCED THROUGH model/arrow.py -- the T-54/T-55 fold-in, T-46 pattern.

Each check recomputes a registered headline number through the arrow layer and gates it
against the SEALED value copied from the lane's own sealed output file:

DISCIPLINE: D-8 -- wherever a computed comparison exists it is the gate (closed form vs
chi; the reversal equality; instrument-vs-instrument cross checks); the transcribed
sealed prints are gated as the SEALED ANCHORS they are, stated as such.  D-15 -- every
zero is gated with a positive control named beside it in the same section.  Plus
API-fidelity probes BEYOND every gated range (lam = 0.5; t = +-3.0; the two-qubit
fragment; a never-sealed bath through the observation gate) -- definition, not shortcut.
