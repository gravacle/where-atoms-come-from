# WHERE ATOMS COME FROM — REGISTER V001

**PURPOSE.** Indexed by QUESTION, phrased the way someone would re-ask it. Before opening any
line of work, search this file for the question first.

Every row carries: the question as it would naturally be re-asked · the ruling · **where the
proof is** · and **the exact condition under which the row reopens**. A row with no reopen
condition is closed permanently.

**APPEND-ONLY.** Rows are never edited, only superseded by a later row citing the earlier one.
**This register adopts nothing and derives nothing.** It records where rulings live.

**POINTER RULE (custody §1):** no term appears in a row without a digest, a `file:line`, or a
named ruling behind it.

## HOW TO USE THIS REGISTER

Search by the question you are about to ask. If it is here, read the row and its reopen
condition before commissioning anything.

## W-01 — CAN A FORMATION CONDITION BE WRITTEN ON K1'S OWN DATA, WITHOUT A STIPULATED SPLIT? (S2; construction pair, build + adversarial audit. **AUDIT REFUTED THE BUILD AND WROTE THE CONDITION THE BUILD DECLARED UNWRITABLE.**)

**RULING: YES — WITH ZERO ADDITION AND NO IMPORTED SPLIT.**

**THE CONSTRUCTION.** Extend loop transport from a single fibre to the section space
`Gamma(L) = C^5` that the build itself derived:

```
(M_gamma s)(v) = W(gamma) · s(v)   for v on the loop
(M_gamma s)(v) = s(v)              otherwise
```

These are **unitary and non-scalar** on `Gamma(L)`. Then

```
<M_dF s, M_c s> = conj(W_F)·W_C·p_0  +  conj(W_F)·(p_1+p_2)  +  W_C·(p_3+p_4)
```

which vanishes **iff 0 lies in the convex hull of three unit-modulus coefficients** — verified
against brute-force simplex minimisation, 1369 grid points, 0 mismatches.

**IT FIRES ON S1'S OWN PUBLISHED CONNECTION.** With `W_F = -1`, `W_C = -i` (S1 §6) and
`p = (1/2, 0, 0, 1/4, 1/4)`, the overlap is `i/2 - i/2 = 0` **exactly**.

**PROPERTIES, ALL CHECKED:** gauge-invariant · correct trivial limit (no formation at
`W_F = W_C = 1`) · **the root can never fire**, independently reproduced · and it
**distinguishes curvature from flat holonomy**, which K1 exists to separate and which the
build's own rival construction could not see (its self-reported defect F1).

**THE ONLY LOAD-BEARING OBSTRUCTION IS DURABILITY.** Over `n` circuits the condition fires —
`0.0247` at `n = 42` — and then **recurs to `0.99994`**. K1 is finite and closed; this is a
**reversible write, not a durable record**, reproduced from first principles on five vertices
rather than inherited.

**WHAT THE BUILD CLAIMED, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG.** It returned a threefold impossibility —
rank, no time, no split. **Two are false and one is overstated.** Its rank theorem was proved
on `L_v0 = C`, an alternative its **own choice ledger had rejected**, and then applied to the
`Gamma(L) = C^5` it had chosen; `|<s, M_dF s>| = 0` on K1's own connection refutes it directly.
Its no-split theorem — resting on `dim = 5` being prime — is refuted: reduced states exist
(the build computed one), a canonical three-way direct-sum split exists, and `C^4 = C^2 (x) C^2`
on the non-root subspace. Only a weaker structural half survives: no *canonical* factorisation.
Its no-time claim is overstated — **circuit count is carrier-supplied discrete time.**
And its "minimum addition" question dissolves: **zero addition suffices.**

**A RESULT INSIDE THE CORRECTIONS THAT MATTERS ON ITS OWN.** A canonical three-way split
**exists on K1 and is derivable from its incidence** — `{v0} / {v1,v2} / {v3,v4}`: the root, the
filled triangle's other vertices, the unfilled triangle's other vertices. The
source/record/environment *shape* the predecessor introduced by imperative is **available here
without being imposed.**

**WHERE THE PROOF IS.** Build `S2_FORMATION_CONDITION_ON_K1_V001.md`
sha256 `248ce856efaef157c68e818dde589d0200bbc1dd9fd9fc1fcc8cdc7bc88734d9`.
Audit `S2_FORMATION_CONDITION_ON_K1_AUDIT_V001.md`
sha256 `0bea11bd4b7764f65c8d44cc8812d43bdcc569d34f51d0c46d82851a2efbd0d5`.
All 16 of the build's file:line pointers resolve; all 5 digests verify at bytes; alpha not
engaged. Numeric corrections carried: the build's §3.4 table is non-reproducible and its
corrected row values are `0.000000 / 0.816497 / 0.816497 / 1.000000`; the recurrence figure
`0.994373` is a window artefact and the true supremum is at least `0.999793`.

**GRADE: ADVERSARIALLY-CHECKED, NOT INDEPENDENTLY-CORROBORATED.** Build and audit share a model
lineage (custody §4). A failure mode common to that lineage passes through both.

**REOPENS IF:** a lineage-independent lane fails to reproduce the firing on S1's connection ·
the convex-hull criterion fails on a carrier where it should hold · or the three-way split's
derivability is shown to depend on K1's particular vertex count rather than on its incidence.
