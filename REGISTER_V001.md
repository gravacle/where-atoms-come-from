# WHERE ATOMS COME FROM — REGISTER V001

**PURPOSE.** Indexed by QUESTION, phrased the way someone would re-ask it. Before opening any
line of work, search this file for the question first.

Every row carries: the question as it would naturally be re-asked · the ruling · **where the
proof is** · and **the exact condition under which the row reopens**. A row with no reopen
condition is closed permanently.

**APPEND-ONLY.** Rows are never edited, only superseded by a later row citing the earlier one.
**This register adopts nothing and derives nothing.** It records where rulings live.

**POINTER RULE (custody §1):** no term appears in a row without a digest, a `file:line`, or a
named ruling behind it.

## HOW TO USE THIS REGISTER

Search by the question you are about to ask. If it is here, read the row and its reopen
condition before commissioning anything.

## W-01 — CAN A FORMATION CONDITION BE WRITTEN ON K1'S OWN DATA, WITHOUT A STIPULATED SPLIT? (S2; construction pair, build + adversarial audit. **AUDIT REFUTED THE BUILD AND WROTE THE CONDITION THE BUILD DECLARED UNWRITABLE.**)

**RULING: YES — WITH ZERO ADDITION AND NO IMPORTED SPLIT.**

**THE CONSTRUCTION.** Extend loop transport from a single fibre to the section space
`Gamma(L) = C^5` that the build itself derived:

```
(M_gamma s)(v) = W(gamma) · s(v)   for v on the loop
(M_gamma s)(v) = s(v)              otherwise
```

These are **unitary and non-scalar** on `Gamma(L)`. Then

```
<M_dF s, M_c s> = conj(W_F)·W_C·p_0  +  conj(W_F)·(p_1+p_2)  +  W_C·(p_3+p_4)
```

which vanishes **iff 0 lies in the convex hull of three unit-modulus coefficients** — verified
against brute-force simplex minimisation, 1369 grid points, 0 mismatches.

**IT FIRES ON S1'S OWN PUBLISHED CONNECTION.** With `W_F = -1`, `W_C = -i` (S1 §6) and
`p = (1/2, 0, 0, 1/4, 1/4)`, the overlap is `i/2 - i/2 = 0` **exactly**.

**PROPERTIES, ALL CHECKED:** gauge-invariant · correct trivial limit (no formation at
`W_F = W_C = 1`) · **the root can never fire**, independently reproduced · and it
**distinguishes curvature from flat holonomy**, which K1 exists to separate and which the
build's own rival construction could not see (its self-reported defect F1).

**THE ONLY LOAD-BEARING OBSTRUCTION IS DURABILITY.** Over `n` circuits the condition fires —
`0.0247` at `n = 42` — and then **recurs to `0.99994`**. K1 is finite and closed; this is a
**reversible write, not a durable record**, reproduced from first principles on five vertices
rather than inherited.

**WHAT THE BUILD CLAIMED, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG.** It returned a threefold impossibility —
rank, no time, no split. **Two are false and one is overstated.** Its rank theorem was proved
on `L_v0 = C`, an alternative its **own choice ledger had rejected**, and then applied to the
`Gamma(L) = C^5` it had chosen; `|<s, M_dF s>| = 0` on K1's own connection refutes it directly.
Its no-split theorem — resting on `dim = 5` being prime — is refuted: reduced states exist
(the build computed one), a canonical three-way direct-sum split exists, and `C^4 = C^2 (x) C^2`
on the non-root subspace. Only a weaker structural half survives: no *canonical* factorisation.
Its no-time claim is overstated — **circuit count is carrier-supplied discrete time.**
And its "minimum addition" question dissolves: **zero addition suffices.**

**A RESULT INSIDE THE CORRECTIONS THAT MATTERS ON ITS OWN.** A canonical three-way split
**exists on K1 and is derivable from its incidence** — `{v0} / {v1,v2} / {v3,v4}`: the root, the
filled triangle's other vertices, the unfilled triangle's other vertices. The
source/record/environment *shape* the predecessor introduced by imperative is **available here
without being imposed.**

**WHERE THE PROOF IS.** Build `S2_FORMATION_CONDITION_ON_K1_V001.md`
sha256 `248ce856efaef157c68e818dde589d0200bbc1dd9fd9fc1fcc8cdc7bc88734d9`.
Audit `S2_FORMATION_CONDITION_ON_K1_AUDIT_V001.md`
sha256 `0bea11bd4b7764f65c8d44cc8812d43bdcc569d34f51d0c46d82851a2efbd0d5`.
All 16 of the build's file:line pointers resolve; all 5 digests verify at bytes; alpha not
engaged. Numeric corrections carried: the build's §3.4 table is non-reproducible and its
corrected row values are `0.000000 / 0.816497 / 0.816497 / 1.000000`; the recurrence figure
`0.994373` is a window artefact and the true supremum is at least `0.999793`.

**GRADE: ADVERSARIALLY-CHECKED, NOT INDEPENDENTLY-CORROBORATED.** Build and audit share a model
lineage (custody §4). A failure mode common to that lineage passes through both.

**REOPENS IF:** a lineage-independent lane fails to reproduce the firing on S1's connection ·
the convex-hull criterion fails on a carrier where it should hold · or the three-way split's
derivability is shown to depend on K1's particular vertex count rather than on its incidence.

## W-02 — DOES A DIRECTED SYSTEM OVER K1 ESCAPE RECURRENCE, AND DOES IT PRODUCE THE NINE? (S3; construction pair. **AUDIT CONFIRMED-WITH-CORRECTIONS — every computable claim reproduced in a fresh independent implementation, no arithmetic error found anywhere.**)

**RULING: THE CROSSING EXISTS. THE LIMIT ESCAPES. SEVEN OF THE NINE HOLD OUTRIGHT; TWO HOLD IN THE LIMIT AND FAIL AT EVERY FINITE STAGE — WHICH IS WHY THE PREDECESSOR RECORDED ONE OF THEM FALSE.**

**THE SYSTEM.** `A_N = M_5(C) (x) M_2(C)^(x)N`, dimension `25·4^N`, embeddings
`iota_N(X) = X (x) I_2` — verified unital, multiplicative, *-preserving and isometric — with
`A_infinity = UHF(5·2^inf)`: simple, unital, infinite-dimensional. **Cost: one qubit per cell,
proved minimal. This is not zero addition.** The record slot is non-abelian by necessity: a
unitary write onto a reset carrier leaves *pure* slot states, and pure states of an abelian
algebra have overlap only 0 or 1.

**THE TRAP WAS REAL AND IS DISARMED BY COMPUTATION.** Repeated circuits of one loop span
**3 dimensions at N=1 and 3 at N=100.** Circuits grow no algebra and escape nothing.

**THE MECHANISM IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, AND THE AUDIT'S CORRECTION IS THE FINDING.**
The escape is **not** "recurrence is gone" — **the carrier's recurrence is untouched**,
`sup |Z_k| = 1`. It is **"the record grew."** And the monotonicity theorem carrying the escape
is a **tautology of any per-cell tensor system**: it holds identically on families that never
form at all. **All the content sits in the divergence `Sum (1 - z_n) = inf`.**

**AND THE ESCAPE IS CONDITIONAL IN TWO WAYS, NOT ONE.** The build flagged the **cell schedule**
— an adversarial schedule locked to the carrier's near-recurrences defeats the crossing
entirely. The audit found the second, flagged nowhere: **the support of the ready state.**

**THE CRITERION, CORRECTED AND PROVED, VERIFIED 10/10 ACROSS ALL FOUR SUPPORT CLASSES.**
With `u = conj(W_F)`, `v = W_C`, characters `chi_0 = uv`, `chi_F = u`, `chi_C = v`,
support `S = supp(p)`, and `G = <chi_a/chi_b : a,b in S>`:

```
FORMATION OCCURS  <=>  G != {1}
```

`|S|=3 -> G=<u,v>` · `S={0,C} -> <u>` · `S={0,F} -> <v>` · `S={F,C} -> <u/v>` ·
`|S|=1 -> never`, which **recovers W-01's "the root can never fire" as a special case.**
**Formation is a group-theoretic condition on where the record sits.**

**THE NINE.** P-2 persistence · P-3 thresholded non-return (**exactly, not asymptotically**) ·
P-4 recoverability · P-5 redundancy · P-6 asymptotic centrality · P-7 sector-hood ·
P-8 inductive compatibility — **all HOLD**, each with its computation.
**P-1 durability-with-irreversibility and P-9 orthogonal reduced supports HOLD IN THE LIMIT AND
FAIL AT EVERY FINITE STAGE**, exhibited with an explicit reversing unitary at N = 1..5.
**P-9 is resolved: `||omega_F^N - omega_C^N|| -> 2.000000000000`. The predecessor recorded it
false because it is a limit property and was evaluated at a finite stage.**

**TRANSPORT (Q5): YES, MULTIPLICATIVELY.** `Phi_{N+1} = Phi_N · Z_{N+1}`, and the difference
functional is compatible with the embeddings. **Firing is absorbing.** And the limit converts
W-01's **binary** convex-hull criterion into a **rate** `lambda = -0.766802`, defined everywhere
off the trivial connection.

**CORRECTIONS THAT MATTER.** A claimed unital embedding of `M_5 (x) M_2^{(x)N}` into
`M_5^{(x)(N+1)}` is **false for every N**, by the divisibility criterion the same section
states. And the universal claim that every non-trivial connection forms is **false** — four
exhibited families never form, one of them **on K1's own published ready state**.

**WHERE THE PROOF IS.** Build `S3_THE_CROSSING_V001.md`
sha256 `cbf1d79679ca2ecf3ee260e8a6467062e3a93260b2325cfc287c261e9b4469cb`;
audit `S3_THE_CROSSING_AUDIT_V001.md` per its sidecar. The build self-reported eleven defects
including a one-character digest error in its own custody block, caught by the pointer rule and
recorded rather than silently fixed.

**GRADE: ADVERSARIALLY-CHECKED, NOT INDEPENDENTLY-CORROBORATED** (custody §4).

**REOPENS IF:** a schedule condition is found that is carrier-intrinsic rather than adversarial ·
the ready-state support condition is shown to follow from the incidence rather than being free ·
the rate `lambda` fails to vary with the connection at S4 · or a lineage-independent lane fails
to reproduce the character-ratio criterion.
